Week 10 AssignmentScenario:A software development team was assigned to design a company's internal financial management software. The team consists of multiple programmers and project managers. Everyone is responsible for the different module design of the software. And the code of the different modules must be shared within the team and updated and modified in real time according to the needs of the client. The project manager also needs to communicate with the customer to view the code for the different versions and modules to determine that the software meets the company's financial needs.Using SCM allows programmers or project managers to track back different versions of the software during development, query errors or missing changes to the code even if they are updated. To ensure that the software meets the needs of customers.For programmers on this team, using SCM simplifies their workflow and incorporates everyone's changes in a timely manner.
